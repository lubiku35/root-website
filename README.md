### Project Intro


#### Intro

Hello to all, I'm very glad that you came here to actually read more about demo project LUBIKU. Welcome to version 1.3 of the website project LUBIKU with last upload day on 15th of January 2023. Ufff, almost forgot to introduce author... 

My name is Luboslav Motosicky mostly seen or just appearing as "whoislubiku", yea that's the nick which you see when you  plying CSGO and get headshot, jk. Who don't really know nothing about me, and is interested in doing some more research about me as an author, don't be shy and try to find out more... 

Back to the topic, project LUBIKU is combination of stuff which i personaly do, like, follow and share. Also part of the project is personal portfolio and maybe some more things, okay let's find out.         

### Technologies Used

In this demo version of website I'm using the most common technologies for website development like Hypertext Markup Language, Cascading Style Sheets, JavaScript, PHP Hypertext Preprocessor and relational database MySQLi.   

#### HTML

Back to Basics like HeadieOne and Skepta, chcek out that hit. HTML or Hypertext Markup Language, used to describe the structure of web pages, in this project used quite a lot. All of the text, headings, smaller headings, biggeer heading and other many headings, pictures, links, lists, navigations and more is made by HTML. Dive deeper to what is exacly used on website in [Website Structure](#website-structure) section. 

#### CSS

CSS, Cascading Style Sheets or just guy who represents fasion side of web. CSS is used to style and layout web pages, also widely used in project LUBIKU, exactly 1451 lines of CSS so far. To read more about CSS used in this PROJECT navigate to [Website Styling](#website-styling).   

#### JavaScript

JavaScript not Java - actually the world's most popular programming language that is one of the core technologies of the WWW or World Wide Web, alongside HTML ans CSS. In this project is used one and only Vanilla JS which is just a plain JavaSavacript code without any additional libraries like for example JQuery back in the days. Also no frameworks such as Angular or Vue are used in this project. Btw React isn't actually a framework, in fact it is JS library. To explore more about JavaScript used in project LUBIKU, search here [Client Side Scripting](#client-side-scripting).

#### PHP

PHP was originally an abbreviation of Personal Home Page, but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is mainly focused on server-side scripting. Project Lubiku holds a lot of stuff relevant to PHP, find out more on [Server Side Scripting](#server-side-scripting).

#### MySQLi

The MySQLi Extension (MySQL on steroids) is a relational database driver used in the PHP scripting language to provide interface with MySQL databases. In this project i use this type od database to hold users data.

### Website Structure

Project lubiku contains 2 main parts until now, [Part Lubiku](#part-lubiku) and [Part Blog Project Metanoia](#part-blog-project-metanoia).

Then these parts can be divided into 3 types of components,[Global Sections](#global-sections), [Prime Sections](#prime-sections) and [Lower-Level Sections](#lower-level-sections). I cover these sections more below.

#### Part Lubiku

Role of this part or segment is "index" of the website, that mean the first one which you see if you navigate to **HOME** of the project, it contains sections about author & author projects navigation.
